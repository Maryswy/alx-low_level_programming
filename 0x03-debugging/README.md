Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:

carrie@ubuntu:/debugging$ cat main.c
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
