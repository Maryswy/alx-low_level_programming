Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

C static libraries


General
What is a static library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
Basic usage of ar, ranlib, nm




Bash
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line (why?)
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing
All your files must be executable
